Dismiss
=======

This module allows Backdrop messages to be dismissed via links that are added to
each message. Additionally, a timeout can be set so that `Status` and `Info`
messages can be automatically dismissed (`Warnings` and `Errors` are never
automatically dismissed). These features allow users to quickly close messages
that might otherwise get in the way or cause distractions.

------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > User
